//! Handling of data in Basic Encoding Rules.
//!
//! This crate allows decoding and encoding of data encoded in ASN.1â€™s _Basic
//! Encoding Rules_ as defined in ITU recommendation X.690 as well as their
//! stricter companions _Cannonical Encoding Rules_ and _Distringuished
//! Encoding Rules._
//!
//! You will find a short introduction to ASN.1 and encoding rules as well
//! as a discussion of how decoding and encoding with the crate work in
//! the [guide] module. The documentation with all the other
//! modules serves as a reference documentation.
//!
//! The most important modules of the crate are [decode] and [encode] that
//! provide the machinery for implementing decoding and encoding of data.
//! 
//! Additionally, the crate provides a number of types that help dealing
//! with the more complex universal types in ASN.1. Specifically, the
//! module [int] provides variable length integers, the module
//! [string] contains types for the various kinds of strings defined in
//! ASN.1, and [oid] deals with object identifiers. Finally, [captured]
//! provides a way to keep encoded data around for later processing.
//! The most important types from these modules are also re-exported at
//! library level.

// We have seemingly redundant closures (i.e., closures where just providing
// a function would also work) that cannot be removed due to lifetime issues.
